# DBWorkbench
My take on the MySQL Workbench to connect to a MySQL database and view data in real time, dynamically.
SQL statements working: select, update, create, alter.
Data is retrieved and displayed in a JTable.
meta data is displayed in the JTree.

Uploading the complete Netbeans project folder as a backup. Any changes to the code base is tested and if working with no errors is uploaded as a complete backup.
Using NetBeans v13 for the JSwing components.
